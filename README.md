# Community-Detection-and-Friend-Suggestions
Project on Maximal Clique Detection and Friend Suggestions in the Social Network

Steps to run the code:

1. This code uses dataset from facebook for more than 2000 nodes and 15,000 edges in a graph network.
2. Place the dataset file 'facebook_combined.txt' and java file in same folder.
3. Compile and run the java file MaxClique.java.
3. It will fetch the dataset file and run the algorithm for Maximal Clique Detection of size k.
4. Enter the new node ID when prompted to during the code execution.
5. Enter space seperated IDs of the nodes which are connected to this new node which is to be added into the network.
6. You will see the suggestions of the nodes which are derived from friend suggestion algorithm
